        <p><a href="https://bengras.github.io/i-want-to-get-into-rtems.html">As mentioned</a>, I am interested in
diversifying my OS knowledge further.
<a href="http://rtemsramblings.blogspot.nl/">Joel</a> mentioned he was
teaching an <a href="http://www.rtems.org">RTEMS</a>
<a href="http://rtems.org/wiki/index.php/RTEMS_Training">Open Class</a>
in Munich last month so that was a perfect opportunity to take part.</p>
<p>So I booked a flight, and AirBNB room, and there I was! Coffee,
pretzels (I get it now!), class, beer, food, hacking - heavenly
really.  It was a great experience. For many reasons!</p>
<h2>Reasons the class was great, one: I learned a lot about RTEMS</h2>
<p>Both usage and its internal structure, and real-time systems in general.
I had done some preparation beforehand so that I would get the most out of
the class, but both were something of a first for me.</p>

<p>Pictured above: Joel in front of the projection screen.</p>
<h2>Two: I got to socialize with Joel</h2>
<p>He lives in the US so we don't see each other much. It was great to
catch up a bit and talk about subjects ranging from technical RTEMS
subjects, to life and happiness and such things in general.</p>
<p><img alt="Having a beer with Joel" src="https://bengras.github.io/images/socialize.jpg"></p>
<p>Left: me. Right: Joel.</p>
<p>We all know socializing is simply code for drinking
beer together, no?</p>
<h2>Three: the Beagle BSP</h2>
<p>Based on Joel's suggestion beforehand I had set myself the goal of
writing a <a href="http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/Board_Support_Packages">BSP</a>
for the <a href="http://www.beagleboard.org">Beagle</a> family of products for
RTEMS. In other words, a port of RTEMS to the beagles; specifically
the BeagleBoard XM, BeagleBone 'White,' and the BeagleBone Black.
Joel mentioned this at the start of the 4-day class to the other
participants, so that raised the pressure to succeed within the class
timeframe significantly!</p>
<p>I hacked on it as much as I could between classes and socializing and
"on the last day" I got it working. I really enjoyed Joel demonstrating
it to the rest of the class! We hooked up my laptop to the projector
and went to town.</p>

<p>Pictured: Joel demonstrating RTEMS running on the Beaglebone Black that
I brought with me.</p>
<p>And, also on the last day:</p>
<p><img alt="Joel demonstrating RTEMS on my beaglebone black" src="https://bengras.github.io/images/cert.jpg"></p>
<p>I got a certificate! It really did feel like going back to school and it
was quite a nice experience.</p>
<h2>Where to go</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.rtems.org/wiki/index.php/Beagleboard">The Beagleboard XM RTEMS Wiki page</a> contains something of a history of the RTEMS Beagleboard port. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/claas">Claas Ziemke</a> started an RTEMS BSP for
the original Beagleboard for a GSOC project, so he wrote the basis
for that page. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kiwichris">Chris</a> started the wonderfully-named section 
"Ben and Chris's Big Beagleboard Adventure" - I couldn't have phrased it
better, that's really what it feels like! Also sounds a bit like "Bill and Ted"
and I hope Chris meant it that way too.</p>
<p>The work-in-progress code is at
<a href="https://github.com/bengras/rtems/tree/beaglebone-wip">my github RTEMS fork</a>.</p>
<h2>What next, and: foreshadowing</h2>
<p>I'm really delighted with how far the BSP has come, as it's a first
for me to do something with RTEMS, and indeed get any new OS working
almost-from-scratch on a new piece of hardware. Well.. That's an
exaggeration, as a lot of ARM support was already there. But still,
filling in a few more basics can make it feel like it's from-scratch!</p>
<p>The Beagles are such nice products that it's a real PR opportunity
for RTEMS too I believe, and I'm thrilled to be able to contribute
that to RTEMS.</p>
<p>I have spent a lot of time since then running the full test suite,
and cleaning up the BSP - mostly by minimizing it. Part of the
effort to merge this BSP with mainline is that I am working with
<a href="https://github.com/kiwichris">Chris</a> to get the RTEMS executable
running from scratch using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Test_Action_Group">JTAG</a>.  But
that is a topic of another, similarly exciting, post.</p>
